Each row has information about the county name, the state that the county is in, and the total number of railroad employees in said county. The information is likely collected from the 2012 US Census.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nsummary(railroads)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in summary(railroads): object 'railroads' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Selecting county and total employees\nlibrary(dplyr)\nselect(railroads, `county`, `total_employees`)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in select(railroads, county, total_employees): object 'railroads' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Average # of employees in each state\nlibrary(dplyr)\nrailroads %>%\n  group_by(state) %>%\n  summarise(mean.employees = mean(total_employees, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in group_by(., state): object 'railroads' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## filtering counties with up to 100 railroad employees\nlibrary(dplyr)\nfilter(railroads,`total_employees` <= 100)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in filter(railroads, total_employees <= 100): object 'railroads' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nsummarize(railroads, mean.total_employees = mean(`total_employees`, na.rm = TRUE), median.total_employees = median(`total_employees`, na.rm = TRUE), min.total_employees = min(`total_employees`, na.rm = TRUE), max.total_employees = max(`total_employees`, na.rm = TRUE), sd.total_employees = sd(`total_employees`, na.rm = TRUE), var.total_employees = var(`total_employees`, na.rm = TRUE), IQR.total_employees = IQR(`total_employees`, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in summarize(railroads, mean.total_employees = mean(total_employees, : object 'railroads' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThere are many more counties with a lower number of total railroad employees than those with a higher number of them, which partially explains the low numbers for median and mean, and why the mean is greater than the median. The standard deviation is very high which shows there were outliers with large values, such as Cook County, IL with 8207 railroad employees. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(railroads, aes(x=state, y=total_employees)) + \n    geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in ggplot(railroads, aes(x = state, y = total_employees)): object 'railroads' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nI attempted to create a scatterplot graph to display the amount of railroad employees by state, with each dot representing county. Plenty of states have counties that are more clustered, while some states have one or outlier counties, such as Illinois and New York. When you look into population density of the those states, you can see that the majority of the population lives in a particular area, while the rest of the state is relatively sparse.\n",
